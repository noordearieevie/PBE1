<h2><font color="white">Lasagna</font></h2>
<img width="200" height="200" src="img/lasagna.jpg">
        <p><h3><font color="white">We took a couple shortcuts for this recipe by using store-bought marinara and boxed pasta sheets. It saves a ton of time without sacrificing any flavor. We think it's absolutely perfect as-is, but also understand some people are looking to make sauce from scratch. Use our best homemade spaghetti sauce,it'll NEVER let you down. Regardless of the route you go, make sure to follow these tips.DON'T OVERCOOK YOUR NOODLES.Lasagna noodles need structure,they have a lot of ingredients layered between them!so they can't be too mushy. Make sure to cook them until they're very al dente; they're ready typically two minutes before the amount of time on the box.OIL'EM UP.While you're making your beef and ricotta mixtures, your lasagna noodles will typically be hanging out in a colander, getting stuck together (worst nightmare). To prevent this, after you drain the noodles from the pasta pot, slick them with olive oil and lay them flat on a baking sheet to cool.DRAIN BEEF.Sometimes we're a little lasagna and skip this step when making a meat sauce and we always regret it—the sauce tastes so greasy! Draining the fat from the skillet is a must for your lasagna layers, which will already have a lot of fat from cheese.SEASON YOUR RICOTTA MIXTURE.My Italian grandmother always added a secret ingredient to her lasagna: cinnamon. The ricotta mixture always gets overlooked and, therefore, tastes kinda bland. Make sure to season it generously with salt and pepper—Parm, too!DON'T OVER BAKE.Lasagna is one of those dishes that firms up a lot as it sets. Even though it might look like a cheesy, bubbly mess in the oven, if it's warmed all the way through it will be perfect once you let it sit for like 15 minutes. When you over bake the pasta you run the risk of the noodles drying out and getting too crispy.You'll like our lasagna and will repeatly ordered it for sure!</font></h3>
